# Bake-a-py

Bake-a-py is a simple commandline utility for Linux written in Python. The programm is intended to provision Raspberry Pis with Raspberry Pi OS and the fundamental configuration. It mimicks the rpi-imager, but is a command line tool. This helps in my case to create a basic setup on the SD card or USB drive.
