# Bake-a-py

Bake-a-py is a simple commandline utility for Linux written in Python. The programm is intended for provisioning Raspberry Pis with Raspberry Pi OS and the fundamental configuration. It mimicks the rpi-imager, but is a command line tool. This helps in my case creating a basic setup on the SD card or USB drive.
